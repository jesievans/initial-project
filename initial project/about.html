        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>As a fiber artist, I use what is traditionally viewed as craft media to create conceptual fine art. A very important part of my process is hand making each piece. I come from a background where I often participated in craft projects with my mother, grandmother and great grandmother. Creating art within the medium of craft allows me to fulfill my desire for creative expression while also bringing up my most cherished childhood memories. My art is an extension of my personal experience as well as concepts and opinions about the world outside my immediate scope. My fear, anxiety, joy, and hope are channeled into each piece.</p>
        <p>My conceptual work draws heavily from issues I find relevant to my life as well as the emotions I experience while dealing with those issues. I am currently working on a conceptual body of work based on my main environmental concern. This body of work calls forth my anxiety about the problem as well as my hope for a solution. The craft medium is warm, inviting and accessible to the viewer. This accessibility draws the viewer in and invites them to experience the emotions the conceptual work brings forth.</p>
